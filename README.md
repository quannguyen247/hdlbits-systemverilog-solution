## ðŸ“– Introduction

Welcome to the solutions repository for the problems on [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page). This repository contains **182 complete solutions** written entirely in SystemVerilog.

The goal of this project is to provide a reference source for those who are learning and practicing SystemVerilog through the practical problems on HDLBits. All solutions were done by me.

## ðŸ¤– AI Assistance

In the process of completing this collection, I received partial assistance from AI tools like **GitHub Copilot** for tasks such as:
*   Code formatting.
*   Suggesting variable and module names for clarity and consistency.
*   Quickly generating repetitive code snippets.

However, the core logic of all solutions was analyzed and implemented by me.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The solutions are organized according to the HDLBits category structure for easy lookup and comparison.
